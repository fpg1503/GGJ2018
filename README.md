# GGJ2018 Submission - It's a Trap

A puzzle about the true meaning of friendship by trapping the hell out of the next person that will play the game. HOW-TO's: Use the keyboard arrows to move your character around; avoid turrets and traps, and move boxes to reach the trapdoor. Than, use your coins in the CREATING MODE [tm] to add more traps / remove traps from the stage (if you are into friendliness)!
